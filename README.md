# RuleEngineApp
The project is a 3-tier rule engine application that allows users to input eligibility rules via a React frontend, stores the rules in a MongoDB database, and processes them using a Node.js/Express backend with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure. It evaluates user attributes like age and income to determine eligibility based on dynamic rules.
